# Hi, I'm James Ding (Jiajian) 👋

**Associate Data Analyst** at AirSprint Private Aviation | Calgary, AB, Canada  
Building forecasting models, optimizing analytics pipelines, and turning aviation operations data into actionable insights.  
Aspiring Data Scientist / AI Engineer — currently shipping real ML projects in private jet fractional ownership.

### What I'm Working On Right Now
- **Revenue & Airborne Hours Forecasting** @ AirSprint  
  Developing end-to-end time-series models (Prophet) to predict private jet utilization and support fleet planning during rapid expansion (fleet now 43+ aircraft).
  
- **SQL & Snowflake Optimization** @ AirSprint  
  Improving view performance, fixing metric inflation, and cleaning up legacy flight analytics logic.

- **Super Bowl Prediction Model**  
  XGBoost binary classifier trained on 25+ years of NFL data to uncover winning trends.

- **Pokémon Red RL Experiments**  
  Deep Q-Network agents learning to play the classic Game Boy game (inspired by community benchmarks).

### Tech I Use Daily
**Languages** — Python, SQL  
**Data & ML** — pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, ARIMA, Random Forest, basic RL (DQN)  
**Visualization** — Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI, AWS QuickSight  
**Cloud & Tools** — AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, QuickSight), Snowflake, Jupyter, Git/GitHub, Google Colab

### Things I Love Talking About
- Choosing the right model for the job (XGBoost vs. Random Forest vs. Prophet vs. neural nets)  
- Time-series forecasting in real business settings  
- SQL performance tuning on large datasets  
- Reinforcement learning for games and automation  
- Sports analytics (NFL, NBA, esports)  
- Applying ML creatively (generative coding, image/voice projects)

⚡ Fun fact: I collect weird datasets — Super Bowl box scores, prime rib Friday traditions, you name it.

Open to feedback, collaborations, or junior data science / AI engineering opportunities!
